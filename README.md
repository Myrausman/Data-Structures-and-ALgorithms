# Data-Structures-and-ALgorithms


Welcome to my Data Structure repository, where I have shared my university coursework and implementation of various data structures. This repository serves as a reference for students and professionals who are interested in learning and exploring data structures.

## Contents

The repository contains my work on the following data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Each data structure is in  folder, which contains the implementation in Python and a brief explanation of the concept and implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of computer programming
- Familiarity with Python programming language

## Usage

1. Clone the repository by using the following command:
```
https://github.com/Myrausman/Data-Structures-and-ALgorithms/
```
2. Navigate to the desired data structure folder and open the implementation file in a text editor or IDE.

3. Run the implementation file to see the output and understand the concept better.

## Contributing

If you find any errors or have any suggestions to improve the implementation, feel free to create a pull request. I appreciate all contributions to make this repository better.
